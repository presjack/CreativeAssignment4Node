    1. ng-app='app' tells angular that everything within this div should function within
    the scope of a declared angular module with the name of app.
    2. ng-controller='mainCtrl' tells angular that the scope of this div should be handled
    by a controller by the name of 'mainCtrl'. In a bigger application you will likely have
    multiple controllers within one ng-app

     1. Giving a form a name in Angular is kind of like creationg a javascript object with that name:
     e.g. var userForm = {}
     2. This is the function with the given parameter we want it to be called with when the form is submitted
     'addNew' should be found on the scope of mainCtrl.
     3. .name & .url of userForm is like adding properties to our userForm object. Angular will automatically
     bind values to these.
     e.g. userForm = {
      name: '',
      url: ''
     }
    -->
    <form name='userForm' ng-submit='addNew(userForm)'> <!-- [1], [2] -->

      <input placeholder='Name' ng-model='userForm.name'/> <!-- [3] -->
      <input placeholder='Image Url' ng-model='userForm.url'/>

      <!-- 
      setting button to type submit will trigger the ng-submit of the 
      form that button is a child of.
      -->
      <button type='submit'>Add New</button>
